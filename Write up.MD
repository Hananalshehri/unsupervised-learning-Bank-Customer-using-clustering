#                                                 Bank Customer By using unsupervised learning (clustering- KMeans)

# Abstract:
Banks usually aim to increase profits in many ways, and one of these methods is marketing for loans.
We analyzed bank data that included 41,188 customers, trying to understand their activities in the bank, their ages, jobs, whether they are married or not, their education, and other classifications.
Used unsupervised learning to classify and collect similarities between customers, they were divided into four clusteres. 
Also used Excel to understand the relationships between each clustere.

# Design
Clustering clients based on traits to target them in marketing loan types.
